<h1>Wrestling Nonsense</h1>
<h3>The aim of this website</h3>

Here are the source files of my original PHP projects called "Wrestling Nonsense".
You can have a quick look at <a href="demo_screenphotos/">some demo-screenshots.</a>

This is also a CMS web site with quite similar functionality to Dialang, but this project also includes newly added functions such as 'Create Category' and 'Search.' This website is designed for simply posting reviews of any sporting events.
