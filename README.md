# Quick Explanations About My PHP Projects

 <ul>
   <li>
      <h3>1. Dialang</h3>
      <p>My first CMS website. To create this I used my skills mainly learned on a Udemy course named 'CMS Project Course - Master PHP.' I used procedural PHP here. <br>
      The reason I made this is I wanted to create a website where you can learn languages whilst interacting with each other.   </p>   
   </li>

      <h3>2. Wrestling Nonsense</h3>
      <p>Also a CMS web site with quite similar functionality to Dialang, but this project also includes newly added functions such as 'Create Category' and 'Search.' This website is designed for simply posting reviews of any sporting events.  </p>  
   
   </li>
 
   <li>
      <h3>3. Gallery</h3>
      <p>I created this whilst learning a Udemy course named 'PHP', which is focused on Object Oriented PHP. From the course, I learned the concept of OOP and how to use it in practice, writing all codes whilst to make sure I understand each lecture.</p>

    <li>
      <h3>4. Translation Works</h3>
       <p>As an English speaker as ones second language, I sometimes enjoy to translate from English into Japanese, or visa versa. This site is kind of a notebook for myself to review my English studying. In future years, I'd like to write many articles in various topics translated by myself in this site as a hobby.     </p>
