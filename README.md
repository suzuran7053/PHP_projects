# Quick Explanations About My PHP Projects

 <ul>
   <li>
      <h3>1. Dialang</h3>
      My first CMS web project. To create this I used my skills mainly learned on a Udemy course named 'CMS Project Course - Master PHP.'<br>
      I wanted to create a website where you can learn languages whilst interacting with each other.

   <li>
      <h3>2. Wrestling Nonsense</h3>
      Also a CMS web site with quite similar functionality to Dialang, but this project also includes newly added functions such as 'Create Category' and 'Search.'<br>This website is designed for simply posting reviews of any sporting events.
